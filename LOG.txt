- precondition, postconditions and invariants are not a topic at the moment
- variable table -> nested maps
- we use semi commas
- we use parsec
    * every option probably could work
    * parsec -> documentation, slightly more predefined functions than uu-parsinglib
- functions don't have return values for the time being

- entry point is first statement in the main statement block
