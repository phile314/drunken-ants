This package contains the solution for the Ant project of the course AFP (2013).
The team is composed by:
  Marco Vassena <m.vassena@students.uu.nl> 
  Laurens van den Brink <laurensvdbrink@hotmail.com> 
  Philipp Hausmann <p.hausmann@students.uu.nl>

In order to solve the problem of programming the ants we designed and developed 
a domain specific language (DSL), which allows to express a strategy for the ants
in a more convinient way.
Our compiler (antc), parses the file, matches it against the grammar of the language,
builds up in the process the correspondent abstract syntax tree, which is then 
directly compiled to the lower level ant assembly code. 
Such low level program is written to the output file and can be directly used in the
simulator.

Structure of the project
  src           contains the source files for the Parser and the Compiler of the language
  testsuite     contains testcases used for testing our implementation
  doc           contains further documentation, like the slides of the presentation given during the last lesson
  example       Some example ant files written in our language.
